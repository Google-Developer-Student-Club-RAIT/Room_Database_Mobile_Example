RoomDatabase Example
================

This repository contains the finished sample code for the
[Architecture Components codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) in Java on the master branch and in Kotlin for the [Architecture Components Kotlin codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin) on the [kotlin](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-room-with-a-view/tree/kotlin) branch.

Introduction
------------

In May 2017 Google released the Architecture Components libraries.
Each library manages and simplifies aspects of data persistence and the
UI component lifecycle. Together, the libraries encourage a modular
app architecture that results in reduced complexity and less code.

This sample shows how to use the libraries to build
a complete basic app that implements the recommended architecture
and can be used as a template for further explorations.
